## 2) Eligibility & Accounts
You must meet Discord’s eligibility requirements and comply with its [Terms of Service] and [Community Guidelines]. You are responsible for the permissions you grant the Bot in your server.

## 3) Description of the Service
The Bot provides features such as:

You control which channels the Bot can access. You are responsible for:
- Ensuring access is limited to appropriate channels and roles.
- The content posted in your server.
- Using results appropriately (e.g., complying with labor/wage laws and audit requirements).

**No Professional Advice.** The Bot’s outputs are for convenience only and may contain errors. They do **not** constitute legal, HR, or financial advice.

## 5) Prohibited Use
You will not:
- Violate any law, contract, or third-party right.

- Circumvent role/permission restrictions.

We may suspend or terminate access for violations or risk to the Service.

We (or our licensors) own the Service and associated materials excluding your server content. You grant us a non-exclusive license to process content as needed to provide the Service. You retain your rights in your content.

## 7) Third-Party Services
The Service integrates with Discord and may use third-party processors/hosting (see [Privacy Policy](./PRIVACY.md)). Those services are governed by their own terms and policies.

## 8) Disclaimers
THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED **“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
