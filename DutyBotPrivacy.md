# Privacy Policy for DutyBot

**Effective Date:** 2025-09-03 
**Owner/Operator:** Oinkzlol (“we”, “us”, “our”)  
**Contact:** oinkzlol@gmail.com

We respect your privacy. This Policy explains what we collect, why, and how we handle it for the **DutyBot** Discord bot (the “Service” or “Bot”).

> **Short version:** We only read messages in channels you permit, and only to detect “clock in/out” posts and serve slash commands. We store minimal records (e.g., employee name, duty duration, timestamps) to compute totals and exports. We don’t sell your data.

---

## 1) Data We Collect

### a) Discord Metadata
- Server (guild) IDs, channel IDs (including thread parent IDs), message IDs.
- User IDs and display names (as needed for role checks and naming in stored records).
- Timestamps related to messages and interactions.

### b) Content Needed for Features
- Text content and/or embed text of messages in allowed channels to detect “clock off/out”, “time on duty”, “shift start”, and timestamps.
- Slash command inputs (e.g., employee name, date range) and ephemeral interaction data.
- Computed duty records (e.g., total seconds, day summaries).

### c) System & Logs
- Diagnostic logs (e.g., success/failure of message parsing, errors).  
- Hosting/platform logs (IPs or runtime metadata from the hosting provider).

**We do not** intentionally collect or process special categories of personal data (e.g., health/biometrics) or children’s data. Do not use the Bot for sensitive data.

---

## 2) How We Use Data
- Provide and operate the Bot (parse clock-out messages, compute totals, respond to slash commands).
- Maintain security, prevent abuse, and debug issues.
- Improve reliability and add features (in aggregate and without profiling individuals).

---

## 3) Legal Bases (EEA/UK if applicable)
If you are in the EEA/UK, our legal bases may include:
- **Legitimate interests** (to provide/administer the Bot you requested).
- **Contract** (to deliver functionality to your server).
- **Consent** where required (e.g., if you choose to enable optional features).

---

## 4) Data Sharing
We may share data with:
- **Hosting/Infrastructure providers** (e.g., [Your Hosting Provider], database storage) as processors.
- **Discord** (messages flow through Discord; use governed by Discord’s terms).
- **Service providers** needed to operate the Bot under confidentiality and data-processing agreements.
- **Legal**: if required by law, regulation, legal process, or to protect rights, safety, or the Service.

We do **not** sell your personal data.

---

## 5) Data Retention
- Duty records and related metadata are stored for as long as your server uses the Bot and needs historical summaries.  
- Diagnostic logs are kept for a limited time to troubleshoot (e.g., ~30–90 days) unless required longer for security or legal reasons.

**Your Controls:** Server admins can remove the Bot at any time. You can also ask us to delete stored records (see “Your Rights” below).

---

## 6) Security
We use reasonable administrative and technical safeguards. Data transits via Discord’s encrypted channels. Storage is on our selected hosting/database provider(s). No method is 100% secure, so use appropriate server permissions and restrict Bot access to specific channels.

---

## 7) International Transfers
We may process and store data in countries other than yours. Where required, we implement appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs/DPAs with processors).

---

## 8) Your Rights
Depending on your location (e.g., EEA/UK/California), you may have rights to:
- Access, correct, or delete personal data.
- Object to or restrict processing.
- Data portability.
- Withdraw consent where processing is based on consent.
- Lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority.

**Requests:** Email oinkzlol@gmail.com. We may need to verify your request and may coordinate with the server admin.

---

## 9) Children’s Privacy
The Service is not directed to children. Do not use the Bot in servers or channels primarily for children.

---

## 10) Changes to This Policy
We may update this Policy. Material changes will be indicated by updating the “Effective Date”. Continued use constitutes acceptance.

---
